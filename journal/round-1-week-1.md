## Week 1

**March 2nd - March 8th**

## Day 1 - March 2nd, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

[Drum Kit Challenge - JavaScript 30](https://github.com/jimweigandt/JavaScript30/blob/Drum-Kit/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/index-START.html)

#### Progress today

For the very first day of my #100DaysofCode I did a ton of learning. I started by reading up on Codecademy about Modules and Promises within JavaScript. I felt I grasped Modules pretty well but by the time I got to Promises I honestly felt somewhat overwhelemed. I barely retained any of it so I need to note that Promises is something I need to revist.

I also went ahead and started working on the very first challenge in Wes Bos' JavaScript30 course that he has free online. The first challenge was building a drumkit within a browser. I was initially hoping do to most of it without help but found myself looking back at the video for help.

My attempt at building the drum kit was streamed on Twitch as well and I honestly had fun doing it. Had a couple people come into chat and dropped some nice comments so I am definitely looking forward to streaming more in the future.

#### Challenges you faced

- I need to work on Promises as the basic concept makes sense but connecting the dots on how it works went right over my head
- I was hoping for a better attempt at the drum kit problem in JS30 but found myself referring to the video too often for my liking. However, I was really close on most of the stuff that I was trying to figure out.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

- I'd like to continue the Intro to JavaScript Codecademy module (so close to being done!)
- Complete the next JavaScript30 challenge and attempt to stream it again

## Day 2 - March 3rd, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

[Codecademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

#### Progress today

I went through the Async...Await module on Codecademy and it made a bit more sense than what Promises did yesterday. However, it's still a concept that I'm going to need to keep practicing.

#### Challenges you faced



#### Tasks for tomorrow

## Day 3 - March 4th, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

[Codecademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
[JS and CSS Clock - JavaScrip30](https://github.com/jimweigandt/JavaScript30/blob/Drum-Kit/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock/index-START.html)

#### Progress today

Finished part one of the Request portion of the Introduction to JavaScript on Codecademy's website. Basically learned how to make a boilerplate 'GET' and 'POST' request.

Created the JS and CSS Clock on the WesBos JavaScript30 course. Made sense on how he built it and I'm consistently getting more exposure to different tools to use for buidling in the future.

#### Challenges you faced

Requests fall in the same bucket as Promises and Async...Await that they make sense, but I will need to revisit them to fully understand.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

- Finish off the Introduction to JavaScript course on Codecademy
- Try and complete the next JavaScript30 challenge

## Day 4 - March 5th, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

[Codecademy's Introduction to JavaScript - Requests II](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/requests-ii/resume)


#### Progress today

Finally finished out the Introduction to JavaScript course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) which has been a long time coming. This required learning about Requests for second straight day. The only difference was it including catch, try, incorporating async and await within the requests. Honestly, the only thing that I have picked up this week in regards to Promises and Requests is just being exposed to them. The retention and how they really work is something that is going to take a lot of time. I would like a much better understanding of this concept before I jump into a framework.

#### Challenges you faced

Retention on promises and requests is just not there yet. Pretty much was just exposed to these concepts and that's it.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

## Day 5 - March 6th, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

N/A

#### Progress today

Unfortunatly this was the first day that I failed to do an hour of coding. I actually was not able to do any work whatsoever.

#### Challenges you faced

Just need to get back to it the next day.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

- JavaScript30 challenge

***

## Day 6 - March 7th, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

Finished Challenge 3 of JavaScript30 - Dealing with CSS Variables and JavaScript

#### Progress today

Completed Challenge 3 of JavaScript30 that dealt with declaring variables in vanilla CSS and using them in JavaScript. Basically created scrolling bars and a color picker to blur and change the background square colors. I also found out a cool feature in Chrome DevTools that basically tells you the different built in methods that appear in a NodeList and an Array.

#### Challenges you faced

Everything made sense from the challenge which is nice.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

- Another JavaScript challenge
- Maybe work on a project instead of a tutorial or challenge
