## Day 1

#### Project I am working on 

[Drum Kit Challenge - JavaScript 30](https://github.com/jimweigandt/JavaScript30/blob/Drum-Kit/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/index-START.html)

#### Progress today

For the very first day of my #100DaysofCode I did a ton of learning. I started by reading up on Codecademy about Modules and Promises within JavaScript. I felt I grasped Modules pretty well but by the time I got to Promises I honestly felt somewhat overwhelemed. I barely retained any of it so I need to note that Promises is something I need to revist.

I also went ahead and started working on the very first challenge in Wes Bos' JavaScript30 course that he has free online. The first challenge was building a drumkit within a browser. I was initially hoping do to most of it without help but found myself looking back at the video for help.

My attempt at building the drum kit was streamed on Twitch as well and I honestly had fun doing it. Had a couple people come into chat and dropped some nice comments so I am definitely looking forward to streaming more in the future.

#### Challenges you faced

- I need to work on Promises as the basic concept makes sense but connecting the dots on how it works went right over my head
- I was hoping for a better attempt at the drum kit problem in JS30 but found myself referring to the video too often for my liking. However, I was really close on most of the stuff that I was trying to figure out.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

- I'd like to continue the Intro to JavaScript Codecademy module (so close to being done!)
- Complete the next JavaScript30 challenge and attempt to stream it again
