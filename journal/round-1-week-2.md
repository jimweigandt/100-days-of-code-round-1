## Day 8 - March 9th, 2020

#### Project I am working on 

[Array Cardio - JavaScript 30](https://github.com/jimweigandt/JavaScript30/blob/master/04%20-%20Array%20Cardio%20Day%201/index-START.html)

#### Progress today

Had to squeeze in an hour later in the night that I would've liked but that's what happens when you plan a dinner with friends and also got a 5 mile run in! But I started working on the Array Cardio challenge from Wes Bos which is essentially 8 problems that need to be solve with various array methods so very similar to CodeWars challenges. It took me a couple minutes to warm up to get back in the hang of things. But I used .map .sort. .filter.

The arrow functions within the methods are still throwing me off a bit in the sense that I'm missing a single step on how it actually works.

#### Tasks for tomorrow

- Finished out the array cardio challenge from Wes Bos
- Go through promises (maybe even objects)
